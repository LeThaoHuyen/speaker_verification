# Text-independent Speaker Verification
 
This is the implementation of ResCNN model proposed in [Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02304.pdf).

The model is trained on [TIMIT](https://github.com/philipperemy/timit) train dataset and evaluated on [Voxceleb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bachng/voxceleb) dataset.
